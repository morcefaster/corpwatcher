# "Hello World" - Discord Bot

Welcome to this repository!

This repo is for people who start developing discord bots based on the library **Discord.js** and want to see how a simple project could look like.

Currently you have following functions:

- Changing command prefix (in-code)
- Command: hello -> Sends a message in the channel where the command was executed!
- Command: help -> Just sends a list of the commands (in a embed, so you know how they works)

## Troubleshooting

### Why do I see errors in my editor at the lines where the arrow fuctions are?

You may must change the JavaScript Version in your Editor to ES6.

See [this article by Mozilla](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/) to get a depth view into arrow functions.

(I added this to the troubleshooting cause I had this problem in PHPStorm too)

### I found a bug or I have a suggestion!

Just write an issue here in this repo!
